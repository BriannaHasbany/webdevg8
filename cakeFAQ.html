          We take orders either by phone, email, or through our online form.
          Please give as much lead time as possible. If you have a short-notice
          order, ask us — we’ll try to make it happen! After submitting your

          Because all of our cakes are priced individually by the complexity of
          their design, we do not have a standard price list. Each cake is a
          one-of-a-kind creation, made with care and attention to detail.

          We can print your pictures, corporate logos, or images onto cakes,
          cupcakes, and cookies! Displaying your logo on one of our designs is a
          great way to brand your company. Picture cakes and cupcakes are
          popular for corporate events, retirements, charity events, and
          anniversaries.

        <p>
          We can make display cakes perfect for bridal events, outdoor weddings,
          or magazine shoots. Please note: much of the cost lies in the
          decoration time and detail — whether the base is real cake or
          Styrofoam. Most cakes can be replicated, though there may be small
          variations since each design is unique.

          A 50% non-refundable deposit is required to reserve your order; the
          remaining balance is due at least two weeks before your event. Your
          order is confirmed once we’ve received your signed contract and
          deposit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment can be made by cash, check, or credit card (Visa, Mastercard,
          Amex, or Discover). Deposits are non-refundable. Balance payments are
          refundable only if cancellation is made at least seven (7) business
          days before the event.

          Yes! Delivery is available for all cakes, especially those requiring
          on-site assembly. Delivery fees are based on distance from North
          Andover, MA, and we proudly deliver with Paramount Delivery Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Longer deliveries may be arranged on a case-by-case basis.
          Self-transporting smaller cakes is usually fine, but we do not
          recommend transporting large, 3D, or multi-tier cakes yourself. Cakes
          by Design Edible Art is not responsible for any damage after pickup.
