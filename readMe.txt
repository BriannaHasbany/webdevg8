Original Site: https://www.cakesbydesignedibleart.com/
Improved Site: https://webdevg8.vercel.app/

Our team redesigned the Cakes By Design Edible Art website to modernize its appearance, enhance usability, 
and make it more responsive and accessible. The updated version provides a smoother user experience, 
professional visuals, and clear navigation while staying true to the brand’s creative identity.

----------------------------------------
General Improvements
----------------------------------------
We focused on improving the site’s overall functionality, layout, and consistency. The redesigned version delivers a 
cohesive visual identity and ensures a seamless experience on all devices. The main improvement was the responsive layout, 
which allows desktop, tablet, and mobile viewers to read the information and have an apporpraite layout for their device. 
This includes using a hamburger icon as a menu toggle on mobile. Other general improvements include:
* Unified color scheme and typography for brand consistency.
* Simplified navigation bar and menu structure with dropdowns when apporpraite.
* unified card structure for information with a unified color scheme that is also responsive 
* Added hover animations for interactive and modern design.
* Added a responsive footer with social media icons and contact information 

----------------------------------------
Accessibility
----------------------------------------
Accessibility was a key priority to ensure that all users, including those using assistive technologies, can navigate and 
understand the site’s content. The biggest change was a light/dark mode toggle, which stays consistent as you nagivate 
through the different pages. Other accesibility features include:
* Improved color contrast for text readability.
* Labeled all form inputs and buttons for screen readers.
* Bolded key information in cards 

----------------------------------------
Home Page
----------------------------------------
The homepage was redesigned to make a strong first impression, featuring clear messaging, visuals, and navigation that draw users 
in immediately. The overall layout of the homepage was adjusted to have information sectioned by cards so there were not 
large chunks of information at once. 
* Enhanced layout spacing and text hierarchy.
* Streamlined sections for clarity and user engagement.
* Added an image carousel in the body and not the header to improve text readability and to highlight the images better 
* Embeded instagram posts 
* Included an aniverary card with the locations clearly labeled for users to find the information 

----------------------------------------
About
----------------------------------------
We restructured the About page to better tell the story of the bakery, highlight its values, and present content in a more 
visually appealing way. The original about page included a FAQ section and the order form, both of which we relocated as their own 
pages as part of the contact dropdown menu. The story seemed to get lost in large chunks of text, so the cards were used to section 
information. Images of the owner and her team were also rearranged.
* Reorganized text for readability and flow.
* Styled content sections for modern presentation.
* Added responsive team and shop imagery.
* Improved alignment and balance for a professional look.
* Added a section for the inspiration with an interactive photo gallery. 

----------------------------------------
Services
----------------------------------------
The Services page was redesigned to clearly present offerings in a structured, user-friendly format.
* Added card-style layouts for each service category.
* Included short descriptions for quick recognition.
* Improved visual hierarchy for easier browsing.
* Enhanced spacing and alignment across all viewports.
* Use of images and image captions 
* Embeded Youtube video closer to the bottom of the page in a larger aspect ratio 

----------------------------------------
Galleries
----------------------------------------
We improved the visual impact of the Galleries page to better showcase the bakery’s artistry while maintaining fast performance.
The original website had the gallery as one page and then had users click on certain sections to open the specific gallery.
We instead had each gallery be its own page. The galleries on the original site were also mixed, as some birthday pictures for example
ended up in holidays or the retirement section. We made sure the galleries only included the correct images. 
* Implemented a flexible grid layout that adjusts by screen size.
* Added hover effects to highlight images.
* Ensured galleries were all consistent in formatting 
* Added a lightbox effect so user could enlarge the photos. 

----------------------------------------
Contact Information
----------------------------------------
The Contact page was reorganized to make communication easier and more accessible. THe original contact page had everything on one page, 
which made information difficult to find. The layout was also in need of improvement, especially considering the webpage itself was
not responsive. 
* Spread the contact information onto different pages so users could easily find what they needed. 
* Designed a clean, user-friendly contact form.
* Included an embedded map and clear directions.
* Improved layout for mobile viewing and accessibility.

----------------------------------------
Blog
----------------------------------------
The original blog section had buttons at the bottom to direct the users to certain blog posts. After testing, the company only 
has two blog posts that the links at the bottom bring you to, despite the buttons being named different categories. 
* Used cards in place of the blog posts with newly written descriptions to act as the post. 
* Added images that align with each description 
* Fully responsive grid layout and hover effect
