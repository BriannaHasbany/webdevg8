          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Chef Lina Hunter</strong> was born in
            <strong>Colombia, South America</strong>. After graduating from
            dentistry school in 1996, she ran a dental practice for 11 years.
            Even while working in another field, she always found herself baking
            — crafting chocolates, cookies, and cakes for family and community
            events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following her passion, Lina trained under world-renowned
            confectionery artists including
            <strong>Scott Clark Woolley</strong> and
            <strong>Colette Peters</strong> at the Notter School of Pastry Arts.
            There, she discovered her true calling: creating edible art that
            inspires joy through color, flavor, and imagination.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>2005</strong>, she founded
            <strong>Cakes by Design Edible Art</strong> — a bakery built on
            <em>kindness, peace, love, and happiness</em>. What started as one
            woman’s creative dream has grown into a team of talented artists who
            blend fine art and flavor to craft one-of-a-kind cakes that
            celebrate life’s sweetest moments.
